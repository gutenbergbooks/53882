<p class="chaptitle">HOW BEAUTY WAS SAVED</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the summer of 1862, in the
Bayou Manchac country near
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, there
was a modest little schoolhouse called
the "Dove's Nest." To that school
came two young girls to complete a
course of study begun in Baton
Rouge before the Federals captured
that city.</p>

<p>The country was visited quite often
by bands of Confederates, "Jayhawkers,"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and Federals; the slaves
on the vast sugar plantations were in
a demoralized condition from being
so near the enemy's lines; yet the girls
braved all these dangers, and rode on
horseback (both on the same horse)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
three miles through forest and field
to attend school. They had no fear,
for both could shoot a pistol, and always
carried a loaded one, and a small
Spanish dirk for self-protection. All
the valuable horses on the plantation
having been given to the Confederate
army, only two were left for family
use, an old one, not of much service,
and a young beautiful bay, the individual
property of one of the girls.</p>

<p>This horse the girls rode to school.
Naturally he had a shambling, uncomfortable
gait, but the girls determined
to teach him to pace, which
they did by the use of a small steel
spur.</p>

<p>The days sped on, the year blushed
into spring, bloomed into summer,
and the girls grew accustomed to
meeting bands of the "Blue and the
Gray," sometimes riding along only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fifty yards apart, yet totally ignorant
of the fact. The girls narrowly
missed being shot on one occasion,
as some soldiers were firing down the
road for practice, and the bullets
whistled near their heads as they
turned a curve in the lane. The booming
of cannon could be heard from
the Mississippi River; now and then a
friend was killed in a roadside skirmish;
loved ones were captured and
imprisoned; but the little school
was undisturbed outwardly, though
thrilled with anxiety and patriotism
for the beloved Southland.</p>

<p>When the days grew too long and
hot for study, the earnest little teacher
decided to close the term with a
thorough, old-fashioned examination,
and a modest exhibition.</p>

<p>The neighborhood had been quiet
for some weeks and no one feared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
visit from the enemy. The "Dove's
Nest" was prettily decorated, a
piano moved in, and all made ready.
The day of the exhibition dawned
bright and fair, the woods were full
of flowers, and nature seemed to
laugh in the glad sunshine. The two
girls arrived early, and one of them
decided to ride to a friend's home a
mile beyond, for a basket of fresh
roses; she told her friend, the owner
of Beauty, of her intention, then
sprang into the saddle and rode away.</p>

<p>When she reached the house she
noticed a horse and buggy under an
old oak near by. She knew it belonged
to an old bachelor who was
slightly deaf (else he would have been
in the Southern army), and that he
had come to take the little teacher to
the schoolhouse. When she dismounted
she fastened her horse under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the same tree, in full view of the
road. The house was surrounded by
spacious grounds, some distance from
the main road, and a broad avenue
led up to it from a large outer gate.
The flowers were soon gathered, and
after a chat with her friends, the girl
started back, when someone cried,
"Just look at the Yankees!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, the house was surrounded
and a company was stationed
at the big gate. The family
stood together on the piazza, pale
with fear, for they never knew what
would happen in those troublous
times. The officer in command told
them that they were in need of fresh
horses to make a raid, and had orders
to "press" any into service that they
could find. Turning to a soldier he
said, "Take that horse from the
buggy, saddle him and see if he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fit for use." This caused the girl
some uneasiness about her friend's
horse, but she hoped the side-saddle
would save him, as it had done when
the Southern army were pressing
horses. Anxiously she waited and
listened. When the man returned,
the Colonel said, "Try the other one."
The girl was trembling now; the
horse was not hers, it was the only
one the family with whom she
boarded could use to send to mill, or
for a physician in case of illness; and
she felt that she could not give him
up without an effort to save him.</p>

<p>"Surely, sir, you are not going to
take a schoolgirl's horse for the Federal
Government!" He smiled and
asked her if she could swear that the
horse was hers. She told him no, the
horse belonged to a schoolgirl friend.
He looked incredulous and said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he suspected it belonged to a rebel
soldier; and, bowing an apology,
again spoke to the man, "Try that
horse." Like a flash a thought came
to the girl. She would not plead or
beg,&mdash;she was too proud for that,&mdash;but
she said:</p>

<p>"Colonel, let me try him for you."</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied, much
amused. "Bring him up, Lieutenant."
The girl had no time or chance
to ask advice from anyone; but she
<i>wore the sharp steel spur</i>. The Colonel
politely offered to assist her in
the saddle, but she sprang up without
touching his hand. Dressed in white
muslin, with braided hair looped back
with pink rosebuds; without gloves,
hat or riding skirt, she slowly started
down the avenue in front of the
house. She let the horse shamble
along in the ugly way he liked until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he reached the large gate where the
company of soldiers were stationed.
They looked surprised to see her riding
down alone on one of the horses
they had stopped to take, but thinking
it must be all right, as the Colonel
was in view, they lined up, saluted
respectfully, and let her pass out.
When she was beyond the last guard,
she said, "Now, Beauty, fly!" and,
as she used the spur freely, they did
fly. For some distance they were in
full view of the Colonel and her
friends who stood waiting on the
piazza for her return, then a curve
in the road put her out of sight.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she heard the
clatter of hoofs behind her, but as the
road was hard, dry and level, and she
knew every foot of it, she hoped to
outrun her pursuers. Glancing back
she saw two soldiers splendidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
mounted tearing after her. The
"Dove's Nest" was in sight now, but
the soldiers were gaining ground.
She could hear the clanking of
swords, the rattle of spurs, and the
hoof beats. On she flew, faster and
faster, for Beauty seemed to feel,
with the rider, that an enemy was
after them. The schoolyard gate was
wide open, and she dashed through
it and up to the porch where an
eager, startled bevy of girls were assembled.
She jumped off quickly
and called to her friend, "Here is
your horse. The Yankees are after
him!"</p>

<p>Just then the men rode up, very
red, very angry, and somewhat
scared, for they were in dense woods
over a mile from their command.
They ordered the girl to get back on
that horse and return to the Colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
She told them that she would not do
anything of the kind; she was a
Southern girl, not subject to Federal
orders, and that they could not compel
her to return. The owner of the
horse said she would go with them,
but they insisted on the girl who ran
away going, too. This she refused to
do, and she told them if they did not
want to be captured by the Southern
boys, they had better not linger.</p>

<p>This had the desired effect, and the
girl who owned the horse, taking a
small child behind her, rode back with
the soldiers. When she arrived, the
Colonel was surprised to see a different
girl on the horse and to know that
his men did not overtake the other
one. The owner of Beauty was very
pretty, very eloquent and spirited,
and she could swear that the horse
was hers, and prove it by people present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so the Colonel allowed her to
keep the horse. Her friend was
greatly relieved, and all rejoiced that
Beauty was not surrendered to the
Federal Government to make a raid
on our own dear soldier boys! This
is a true story, for the writer was the
runaway.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE TELLTALE GLOVES</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Federals having left, and
Beauty being safe, we proceeded
with our exercises that
summer day at the "Dove's Nest."
We passed a good examination, and
just as we were singing our gayest
songs a party of Confederates rode
up. They tied their horses to the
windows and doors, came in, and enjoyed
the little concert. After the
last melody had died away and the
shades of evening were falling, we
rode slowly homeward, each girl with
a soldier boy beside her.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers, in particular,
was a reckless, daring young man,
who had shot at the Federals from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ambush many times, had captured
some of their horses, and was quite
a terror to the raiders. His father's
home was in that neighborhood, and
the Federals were trying to capture
him.</p>

<p>Now, when the boys&mdash;for they
were only boys&mdash;left us at the gate
this particular one forgot his gloves&mdash;left
them on a gate post. We
found them, took them into the house,
and threw them carelessly on the hall
table. There were no millinery stores,
in fact no stores of any kind in the
country, so the girls, for riding hats,
wore boys' hats, with a plume jauntily
pinned on the side. We took our
hats off and laid them on the table
<i>by the gloves</i>. The boy's nickname,
"Little Dare Devil," was on the inside
of the buckskin cuffs, but we
had not noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>That night we were aroused from
sleep by the barking of dogs, the rattling
of sabers and spurs. We knew,
as soon as we were well awake, that
the Federals were in the house, and,
slipping on our wrappers, we ran to
mother's room, for we could hear
them beating on our doors. We were
dreadfully frightened, for there was
an unfinished suit of Confederate
gray in the house, and we knew that
if it was found the house would be
burned to ashes. Mother, who had
the suit in her room, would not
"strike a light" until the suit was
concealed, and the pelican buttons
slipped into her pocket.</p>

<p>The Federals kept calling loudly
for <i>light</i>, and we heard them burst
into our room, saying, "Here they
are, boys! The bed is right warm!
Be quick!" We knew, then, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
they were looking for Confederate
soldiers.</p>

<p>The house was searched from garret
to cellar, but, finding no one except
members of the family, the
intruders hurriedly departed. Next
morning our hats and gloves were
missing, having been taken from the
hall table. A few days after this the
Federals were out again, but this
time in daylight. One of the officers
came in the house and asked for a
drink of water. While waiting for
it to be drawn cool and fresh from the
well (for Southerners were courteous
to an enemy when he stood upon their
threshold), he seemed disposed to
chat with the girls.</p>

<p>"We came very near catching
those fellows the other night," he
said; "we got their hats and gloves,
and saw their blankets on the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Where in the world did they hide,
young ladies?"</p>

<p>We were very indignant; and told
him that no Southern soldier would
sleep in a private house so near the
enemy's lines, and thus endanger the
lives and property of his relatives
and friends. We said that the hats
<i>were ours</i>, and we would like them
returned, and that the roll of blankets
was used by a little colored girl
who slept in the house, which fact
they would have discovered if they
had not been nearly scared to death.
The officer looked astonished and
seemed somewhat ashamed of the
whole affair, but some of them did
not believe us, for they rode away
laughing about the <i>name inside the
gloves</i>.</p>

<p>After school closed I had returned
to my home, which was about nine
miles from the Federal lines. We
had a small, rude tannery, for our
family, including the servants, was
quite large, and, as there was no place
to get shoes in that part of Louisiana,
my father employed a shoemaker and
tanned his own leather. Our home
was beautiful, with spacious grounds
around it, and every nook and corner
was dear to us. A clear winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stream ran nearly around the plantation,
and on the river was our "primitive"
tannery. We had all been supplied
with hard yellow shoes (the
first tan-colored shoes we had ever
seen, which we were much ashamed
of), and there were some hides
left.</p>

<p>My father, hearing one day that
the report had been carried to Baton
Rouge that he was tanning leather
for the Southern army, anticipated
trouble, fearing the loss of his precious
leather. He decided the best
thing he could do would be to hide it
in some secret place. He was afraid
to trust the servants,&mdash;for while
some were faithful, others were not,&mdash;so
he told the two youngest girls
of his plan, and asked them to help
him store away his valuable leather.</p>

<p>When the servants were all asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in their cottages, we three, father and
two young girls, dragged those things
to the house, then upstairs, and into
a long, dark closet. The house was
two and a half stories high, so there
was quite a space under the roof. We
conquered our dread of dark, dust,
spiders, and mice, and climbed up
into the space just under the roof.
Father handed up the hides to us
and we hid them carefully and with
many frights from imaginary terrors.
After all was done we came
down, closed the narrow little door,
hung some dresses over it, and
awaited future action on the part of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Sure enough, in a day or two the
Federals came. Before we knew it
the house was entirely surrounded by
troops. The officer dismounted and
knocked at the door. He asked to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
my father, who met him at the hall
door.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "I am informed
that you are tanning leather, and
making boots for the Confederate
army. I have come to destroy your
tannery and burn down your house.
Take your family out immediately."</p>

<p>My father, my aged mother, and
we, his daughters, who had enjoyed
and loved the beautiful home so long,
were speechless for a moment, and
pale with fear. Then father said,
slowly, "The report is false. We
have a rude tannery, but only for
home use," and begged him to spare
the sacred old place. The Colonel
said that he must search the house
and see if any evidence could be
found against us, and, taking several
well-armed soldiers with him, he
went through every room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course we could not follow
them, but we anxiously waited for
their return. The Colonel must have
been touched by our mute grief, but
he only said, "I have orders to burn
the house, and though I find no proof
against you, I must obey orders."
Then father asked him to step out
on the veranda. They talked a few
minutes, clasped hands, and the Colonel,
quickly wheeling around, ordered
the troops out of the house. In
a few minutes every one was in line
and rapidly marching away. In answer
to our astonished inquiries, we
were told that a Masonic sign, the
secret of true brotherhood, had saved
our dear home from desolating
flames.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A LABOR OF LOVE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day a little girl was
reading a story-book on the
green lawn in front of a
Southern home; two gentlemen were
seated near under a wide-spreading
magnolia tree talking about the political
situation, the number of Presidential
candidates, and the possible
results of the election. Suddenly
one of them said, "Yes, there is
trouble ahead. Before that child is
grown this country will be plunged
into bloody war." The child was
startled. The prophetic words were
indelibly stamped on her mind. She
could not sleep until long after midnight,
and when she slept she
dreamed that she, like the "Maid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Monterey," gave food and water to
the thirsty soldiers, and dressed their
bleeding wounds.</p>

<p>The dream came true. While she
was attending school in the capital
city, talk of secession began, and then
came preparations for war. I remember
the day the arsenal at Baton
Rouge was seized by Louisiana, and
all the citizens and the college girls
marched down to the barracks on the
river to see our soldiers drill. The
women and girls went to work making
clothes and little conveniences for
the soldiers to take with them. In a
few weeks we were thrilled with enthusiasm
when our first companies
marched through the city with their
knapsacks, blankets, and a half loaf
of bread strapped on their backs.
Poor boys, they lived to learn that
"a half loaf is better than none."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after two companies<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
were camped near us on the Comite
River, and real work began. How
young and brave the soldiers were,
and how proud every woman was who
had a son, brother, or sweetheart in
the army! For a time all was excitement,
gaiety, and preparation; bands
played, soldiers drilled, and citizens
flocked to the camps to encourage and
help in every way possible. One sad
day orders came to move to the front.
Knapsacks were packed, tents were
folded, the last good-byes were
spoken, tears fell softly but were
dashed away, and our boys were gone&mdash;gone
to meet their fate, whatever
it might be!</p>

<p>Soon after came the hard times.
Luxuries were given up, privation
was felt in every home, but no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>complained. People seemed proud
to endure, and often met to exchange
opinions and plans as to how to
"make something out of nothing,"
as they expressed it. Old looms were
brought out and repaired, and the
spinning wheels were put to work.
Flour, tea, coffee, and even salt
ceased to be used on the family table.
From the smoke-houses, where the
salt meats had dripped for years, the
salt-soaked earth was taken up,
boiled in a vessel, the salt extracted,
and dried in the sun. Sweet potatoes
were sliced thin, cut in little pieces,
browned in an oven, ground in a coffee
mill, and a breakfast drink made
from them. It looked like coffee, it
was not injurious, so it was cheerfully
taken in place of fragrant Mocha.
Okra seed, parched corn meal, and
parched peanuts were also used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
making a morning drink. "Confederate
cake" was made by sifting corn
meal through a sieve, and then
through cloth. Rice was harvested,
and husked in a wooden mortar, a
work which required time and
strength. All dress-goods became
scarce&mdash;calico was $4 per yard and
very hard to get. Jaunty dresses
were made of coarse yellow domestic,
piped with bright colors. No hats
could be purchased, but stylish turbans
were made of old straw covered
with scraps of black silk or velvet,
and were worn with pride, and called
"Beauregard" hats. This recalls a
song that was very popular in Louisiana
during the war. It is a wee bit
touching to read it over now, for the
Southern girls, daintily reared, sadly
missed their fine linen, their soft
silks and sheer muslins. The song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was sung to the air of "The Bonny
Blue Flag."</p>

<p>The war dragged on. New Orleans
fell. Baton Rouge was in the hands
of the enemy. Some of the Baton
Rouge people refugeed to the country,
living in churches, schoolhouses
and deserted log cabins; others were
compelled to remain, as they had no
shelter and no means of living outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the city. Then followed the
sieges on the Mississippi River, Port
Hudson, and Vicksburg. Night after
night and all day long we could
hear the heavy guns booming and the
deadly shells hissing, and we had no
means of knowing how our armies
were faring. I remember the sad
and anxious dread which came over
me every time a gun was fired, and
how I covered my head with pillows
to shut out the fearful sound.</p>

<p>One day in August the news came
that Gen. John C. Breckinridge was
on his way to attack Baton Rouge;
that his army of less than three thousand
were tired and in need of food,
and would be glad if the citizens
would send out something to the road
on which they were marching. Every
family in the country began to prepare
food; quantities of green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
corn, potatoes, vegetables, egg-bread,
chickens, in fact, everything that
could be had was cooked, packed in
baskets, and carried out to meet the
army.</p>

<p>General Breckinridge pitched camp
on the Comite River. On a foggy
morning, August 5, the battle was
fought. Historians have told all
about the short, desperate battle. I
remember the great disappointment
that was expressed, and how people
wondered why the <i>Arkansas</i> did not
do her part on the river, where the
enemy's three gunboats made such
havoc. We did not know that she was
lying, entirely disabled, only four
miles away. After the battle the sick
and wounded were taken to Green-well
Springs, a pretty little summer
resort near us, where a hospital was
established, mattresses being laid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the floors of the parlors and dining-room
of the hotel. Southern women
then proved their love and devotion
to their country's defenders. Every
day buggies, drays, and carts went to
the Springs, loaded with jellies,
soups, and every delicate thing that
we could make with our limited
means. The surgeons had no lint to
dress the wounds, so we went home,
tore our finest linen sheets and table
cloths into strips, and with sharp
knives scraped them into fine, soft
lint, for linen makes much better lint
than plain cotton.</p>

<p>During this time General Breckinridge,
who was a very handsome man,
visited our home and dined with us
several times. On one occasion, just
after a charming dinner with the
General and several of his staff as
guests, a heavy storm gathered. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rain fell in torrents all the afternoon.
My parents urged the guests to spend
the night as it was so dark and threatening,
but the General said, "While
it is a great temptation to enjoy for
a few hours the comforts of a home,
duty calls me to my camp and my
boys."</p>

<p>We learned to enjoy our "labor of
love," and memory treasures Green-well
Springs as a sacred spot where
hands, heads, and hearts were used
freely in the service of our beloved
Southland.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE "JAYHAWKERS"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> New Year's Day, 1862,
one of the coldest days ever
known in Louisiana, we
were all seated around a bright wood
fire talking as usual of the war, and
of our absent boys. All were gone
to the front&mdash;not a man was left, except
my father, an aged clergyman.
As we talked, we were startled by the
furious barking of dogs, the tramp
of horses, and a loud "Hello" at the
front gate. When the door was
opened we saw about twenty or twenty-five
men muffled up to their eyes,
muffled quite beyond recognition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The men were riding miserable
ponies, and they looked dreadful in
their disguise, and seemed numb with
cold.</p>

<p>Father answered the call, and
asked what was wanted. The man in
front replied that they were "Government
officials"; that they had
come to search the house, as they
had heard it contained contraband
articles and smuggled goods. We
knew that there was not a shadow of
truth in the statement, so my father
asked to see the Government order.
"You need not trouble about that,
we have it all right!" replied the
leader. Then they pushed their way
into the hall, the parlor, the bedrooms,
and all over the house, opening
trunks, bureau drawers, desks, and
closets. They took every yard of
cloth they could find and everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that looked new or valuable, piling
them on the front piazza. Toilet articles,
ladies' underwear, everything!</p>

<p>My brother was a physician, at that
time a surgeon in a Louisiana regiment,
and we had quite a collection of
jars and bottles of medicine that had
been left over, among them a bottle
of quinine valued at one hundred dollars,
and prized above gold or silver.
This medicine they found, and, sneering
and jeering, placed it with other
things. When they had gone through
every room, they went to the old-fashioned
smoke-house in the yard, where
the home-cured meat, the corn meal
and other such things were kept,
broke open the door and entered.</p>

<p>Hidden away there was a small
demijohn of whiskey, kept for medicinal
purposes, and a box of sugar,
kept also for the sick and suffering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
When they found that, the men went
wild with glee, and they ran, shouting,
to the kitchen for cups and were
soon drinking the fiery liquid. We
stood looking on in agony,&mdash;the old
father, the physician's wife, two
young girls, and several small children,&mdash;all
helpless, at the mercy of a
band of drunken outlaws, two miles
from any help!</p>

<p>After they had swallowed every
drop, and felt warmed and cheered
by the whiskey, they came out and
began to talk about the sad duty of
obeying "Government orders." We
then told them that the report they
had heard was false; that all the
things they had collected on the
piazza were in the house when the war
broke out, and that we could prove it
by the Home Guards, who would
probably be along soon from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
camp near by. Of course, this was a
ruse resorted to in our desperation,
but it had a magical effect. The men
ran to their horses, mounted in haste,
and dashed off through the woods in
a wild gallop. Oh! what a relief, and
how thankful we were! The goods
were left on the piazza floor, quinine,
clothing and all. They never came
again, but the fear of their return
never left us by night or day, until
the war was over.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">MEMORIES OF SLAVE DAYS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rows</span> and rows of white-washed
cottages constituted
the "quarters," with narrow
streets between them, many of the little
homes adorned with bright-hued,
old-fashioned flowers in the front
yards, or with potato and melon
patches.</p>

<p>On cold winter evenings bright
firelight shone from every door and
window. Inside, the father sitting
in the chimney corner, smoking his
pipe while he deftly wove white-oak
splints into cotton baskets; the
mother, mending, or knitting, while
the fat little darkies tumbled about on
the floor, or danced to the music of
Uncle Tom's fiddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The slaves were well fed, well
clothed, well housed, and when ill
they were well nursed, and attended
by a good doctor.</p>

<p>Their houses were warmed by fires
in broad fireplaces, fires which they
kept burning all night.</p>

<p>They had gay "Sunday-go-to-meetin'
clothes," and they generally
went to church, either to the "white
folkses' church," where an upper gallery
was provided for them, or to
their own special service.</p>

<p>If a planter allowed his slaves to
be mistreated in any way, he and his
family were ostracized from society,
and made to feel the disapprobation
of their neighbors. So general was
this method of administering rebuke
that it seemed to be an unwritten law
throughout the South.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as it often happens to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
an overseer of quick or ungovernable
temper would be severe in
punishing an offender; but he soon
lost his place and a kinder man was
employed in his instead.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the "quarters" a
large nursery was situated, and there
the babies and small children were
cared for by the old women while
their mothers worked in the cotton-fields.</p>

<p>White children were taught to
treat the grown-up servants with respect,
and as they could not say
"Mrs." or "Mr.," they called them
"aunt" or "uncle." On Sunday
afternoons the white children were
often sent to read the Bible to the
old colored people, and the children
thought it quite an honor. If any of
the house servants wanted to learn to
read, they were taught, though after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the war we heard this was against the
law. We never knew it!</p>

<p>Half of every Saturday was given
to "the hands" to "clean up," tend
their garden, or go fishing, as they
chose. From ten days' to two weeks'
holiday was given at Christmas
time, and a jolly good time they had&mdash;balls,
parties, and weddings galore!
The white family and their guests
would be cordially invited down, and
they always enjoyed the festivities.
<i>Noblesse oblige</i> was recognized everywhere,
and we felt bound to treat
kindly the class dependent upon us.
Young ladies parted with many a
handsome gown or ribbon because
their maids wanted them and boldly
asked for them. We simply could
not refuse, and they knew it.</p>

<p>The faithfulness and devotion of
the slaves has been written of by historians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and they deserve all praise,
for many of them were noble and
self-sacrificing. After the war many
of them remained at the old homestead
with their former owners, as
long as they could be provided for,
and when poverty compelled a separation,
they left the homestead with
sorrow.</p>

<p>We of the South are glad and
thankful that the negroes are free.
We would not have them in bondage
again if we could. <i>"Social equality"
can never exist in the South</i>, but the
race can be, and many of them are,
well educated, happy and prosperous:
living in peace and harmony with
their white neighbors, who are, and
have been for many years paying
taxes to educate them.</p>

<p>It is the "floating" class of colored
people that cause the trouble we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
read about in the daily papers. Those
negroes who have been reared in the
South, and know the old traditions,
are law-abiding citizens with comfortable
homes, good schools, fine
churches, and every chance to be
prosperous and contented.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A NARROW ESCAPE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bright, beautiful day, we
were all made happy by a
visit from the oldest son of
the family, a surgeon in the Confederate
army. The river, winding almost
around the plantation, was "up
to its banks" from recent heavy
rains, all the bridges had been destroyed,
and we felt comparatively
safe from the Federals on the other
side, though Baton Rouge was only
nine miles away. The Doctor, who
wore Confederate gray ornamented
with Louisiana pelican buttons, rode
a fine large horse, which he left in the
stables some distance from the house.</p>

<p>Sitting around the broad fireplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in mother's room, talking of the home
people and the war, we were enjoying
the unexpected visit, when one of the
girls chanced to look out through the
south door. She turned very pale,
and exclaimed, "Look at the soldiers!"
All around the kitchen, talking
to the servants, and all over the
grounds were Federal soldiers on
horseback.</p>

<p>What was to be done? If our
brother was captured it meant imprisonment
to the end of the war, and
perhaps death. When he realized the
situation, for he had been near the
door and knew they had come for
him and were questioning the servants,
he dropped on his knees, crept
into a small room adjoining, where
two of us pulled off his gray coat and
replaced it by an old one from the
wardrobe, gave him a book, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
someone whispered, "Go into the
guest-chamber and wait. Take these
old trousers with you." He slipped
into the quiet room, and taking a seat
by the window, and opening the book,
assumed the rôle of an invalid. Then
we hastily concealed the Confederate
uniform, but where we put it I can
never remember. It was securely
hidden.</p>

<p>By that time the Federal officers
and some of the men were in the
house looking around with curiosity,
but they offered no explanation about
their call. There were five or six
bright, pretty girls in the house, and,
contrary to our usual custom, we
chatted with the officers and used all
our attractive powers to keep them in
front of the house and on the broad
veranda. Our attentions seemed to
please them, and the private soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were quietly ordered out and were not
allowed to search for and appropriate
valuables as they usually did.</p>

<p>In a little while the Federals, the
girls, and the family were all engaged
in pleasant conversation on
the piazza overlooking the beautiful
flower-yard and the lovely, peaceful
scene. Someone quietly stole back
to the prisoner's room, told him the
chance to escape had come, gave him
an old hat, and helped him get out of
the window near the garden, a garden
bordered by a dense hedge. Then the
messenger returned to the group on
the porch, and we chatted gaily, while
our hearts were beating with excitement
and anxiety for the fugitive.</p>

<p>After some time the soldiers began
to mount their horses, the servant
having told us in the mean time that
the Yankees had the Doctor's horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
We concluded that the fugitive
would need his horse to get back to
Port Hudson, if he had escaped, and
we felt encouraged to believe he had,
and we determined we would try to
save the horse also. Two of us requested
the Colonel to step into the
parlor, as we wished to speak to him.
He looked a little suspicious and
seemed ill at ease when he had entered
the room and the door was
closed. The large, beautiful room
with its heavy furniture, its bright
brass andirons, its elegant pictures
and wealth of flowers seemed harmless
enough, and one of the girls was
beautiful and bewitching, so he
braved the danger (if there were danger!)
and asked what he could do
for us. We told him a fine horse had
been taken out of our stables by his
men; that we needed the animal as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
we were fond of horseback riding,
and only the old carriage horses were
left to us. He said he was sorry to
refuse our polite request, but his men
had seen the army saddle and bridle;
that it looked like a "U. S." horse,&mdash;in
fact, was branded "U. S.,"&mdash;and
under the circumstances he
would be obliged to take him.</p>

<p>All this time our soldier-brother
was hurrying across fields and woods,
hills and valleys to the banks of
the river, which meant safety on
the other side. The officer, as I
remember across the long years now
passed, enjoyed the novelty of his
position and looked with interest and
a touch of sympathy at the Southern
home and the piquant Southern girls.
When he returned to the veranda the
soldiers mounted their horses, gave
us a respectful salute, and galloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
down the broad avenue. When they
reached the gate a large flock of
geese, about a hundred, furiously attacked
the enemy; their horses reared
and plunged, and the "rank and
file" were so angry because they had
not been allowed any spoils, that they
unsheathed their swords and, leaning
over as far as they could, cut off the
heads of some of our bravest ganders&mdash;the
officers sitting erect, and trying
to look grave. It was an amusing
sight. "They routed them, they
scouted them, nor lost a single man!"</p>

<p>When all had gone we sent a boy
in haste to the ford of the river to
find out about our soldier. He had
crossed the swollen stream in a rude
dug-out with board paddles, and was
safe, safe on the other side.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
